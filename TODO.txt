* get all links from a page

First we need to implement headless browser so some links will work (https://duo.com/decipher/driving-headless-chrome-with-python)

Then we need to create a algorithm for cleaning urls to proper form

Init frontier (dictionary in python)
Add all root urls (.gov.si)

Normalizacija:
    - Brez portov,
    - Dodati zadnji /,
    - Id (#) stran,
    - Brez index.html,
    - Lower case,
    - Encode spaces
